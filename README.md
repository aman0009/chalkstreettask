# Chalkstreet Task

Add cards by clicking on ADD CARD button.The cards will be added in horizontal order with the Record,pause,delete and play button.I have used material design in creating cards and buttons.

The sound will be recorded in background and when you pause it, then you can play it or delete it.As more cards will be added you can record an new sound.As you can not listen the previous sound, because you can not store the audio of more than 5 mb capacity.So automatically it gets deleted but we can download that video if we want.
